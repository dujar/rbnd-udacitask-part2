# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I have used gem rainbow for coloring the background of the priority arrows and aldo the default titles.
I used pp to help me out understand the structure of the data.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) I have added an Error message for invalid number of arguments, if it exceeds the ones provided.
  b) I have provided default values for the options

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
    It took me the whole day. 
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
    I went too much ahead of myself without reading the instructions, so it was adventurous and rewarding since it worked my way.
    The most rewarding I believe will be when I will display the filter items properly. Still trying to figure it out.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    I added error messages because it felt natural to have a set of arguments for the todo lists in order to keep consistency over the outcome.
    Felt natural to provide default values in red, in order for the user to add them later on.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
    I believe I need to find a way on researching efficiently. It is time consuming. I have not yet found a proper website where there would be a sort of abstract about a gem from developers. Lots of room to grow in coding efficiently and think ahead.
